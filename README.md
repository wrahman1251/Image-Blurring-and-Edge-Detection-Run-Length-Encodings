Image-Blurring-and-Edge-Detection-Run-Length-Encodings
======================================================

In this project I implemented two simple image processing operations on color images:  blurring and edge detection. 
I used libraries to read and write files in the TIFF image format.  One option in TIFF files is that they can be
compressed if there are many adjacent pixels of the same color; the compressed form is called a run-length encoding. 
I wrote code to convert an image into a run-length encoding and back.
